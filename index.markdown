I am a third year PhD student at the Institut Fourier (Grenoble)
under the supervision of <em>Erwan Lanneau</em> and <em>Daniel Massart</em>.
#Here is my [CV](/assets/CV_Boulanger.pdf).

I am interested in dynamics and geometry of surfaces. I specifically study translation surfaces and their Veech groups. My other mathematical interests include representations of Fuschian groups,
continued fractions and Anosov dynamics.

I also organise the "Séminaire compréhensible", which is the PhD students seminar of the Institut Fourier. The seminar is usually held on Thursdays and the forthcoming speakers are announced on the <a href="https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/"> Institut Fourier website</a>.
